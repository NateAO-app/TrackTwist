# TrackTwist App Project Outline

## I. Project Description  
TrackTwist is a mobile music recommendation app designed for Android devices. The app provides users with randomized music sample recommendations based on selected genres.  

## II. Problem Addressing  
TrackTwist addresses the challenge of music discovery in an oversaturated market by offering users quick, genre-based sample recommendations without the need for complex searches or paid subscriptions.  

## III. Platform  
The app is being developed for the **Android platform**.  

## IV. Front/Back End Support  
- **Front-end:** Developed using Android Studio with XML layouts and Java or Kotlin code (based on final design decision).  
- **Back-end:** The app is designed for local processing without external server dependency for recommendations. Possible future enhancements may incorporate cloud storage or APIs for additional content.  

## V. Functionality  
- Genre spinner that allows users to select a genre.  
- Button to generate a random music sample within the selected genre.  
- Display of music sample details such as title and artist.  
- Simple and intuitive UI for quick interaction.  

## VI. Design (Wireframes)  
- The main screen features a genre selection spinner at the top, a large spin button in the center, and a display panel below showing the recommended music sample details.  
- Wireframes will be added to this README once finalized.
